## ðŸ‘‹ About Me  

I'm a 3rd-semester Electrical Engineering student at DTU with a passion for embedded systems and hands-on hardware development.  
I enjoy taking ideas from concept to working prototypes, whether it's firmware, PCB design, or full product integration.  

### **Skills & Interests**  
- **Embedded Programming:** C and Embedded C for AVR microcontrollers (ATmega2560), UART, I2C, ADC, and interrupt-driven systems  
- **PCB Design:** KiCad for schematic design and PCB layout, including creating custom footprints for ICs and other components  
- **FPGA Development:** Digital hardware design and simulation using Xilinx ISE  
- **3D Modeling:** Fusion 360 for custom parts and rapid prototyping  
- **Wireless & IoT Projects:** Raspberry Pi-based Wi-Fi audio systems and custom smart devices  
- **FPV Racing Drones:** Designing and building drones from 3D-printed canopies to troubleshooting hardware and firmware issues
